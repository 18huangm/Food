    <p> Lay's is the name of a brand for a number of potato chip varieties, as well as the name of the company that founded the chip brand in the U.S. in 1932. It is also called Frito-Lay. Lay's has been owned by PepsiCo since 1965.Lay's Barbecue-flavored potato chips, which appeared in 1958, was the only flavor available in the United States other than the conventional salted chip until the introduction of Sour Cream & Onion in the late 1970s. In the United States, Lay's offers a number of flavor combinations, in addition to the classic chips. Flavored products in the traditional fried varieties include Sour Cream & Onion, Barbecue, Chipotle Ranch, Cheddar & Sour Cream, Hidden Valley Ranch, Salt & Pepper, Flamin' Hot, Limón, and a thicker "Deli style" chip. The WOW! brand was rebranded in 2004 as Lay's Light after the olestra formula was altered and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration allowed removal of warnings about various health consequences of the fat substitute. Other potato chip flavors offered by Lay's are Garden Tomato and Basil, Honey Barbecue, Sweet Southern Heat Barbecue, Tapatio Limon, Simply Sea Salt Thick Cut, and Dill Pickle Brand.</p>

    <p> Ritz Crackers are a brand of snack cracker introduced by Nabisco in 1934. Outside the United States, the Ritz Cracker brand is made by a subsidiary of Mondelēz International.They are circular, salted lightly on one side, and have a small scalloped edge. A single serving (about 5 crackers) contains 79 calories, 1 gram of protein and 4 grams of fat, or 70 calories and 2.5 grams of fat for the whole-wheat variety.Looking to compete with a cracker made by their competitor, Sunshine Biscuits, they tasked an employee, Sydney Stern, to create a name and advertising plan. Inspired by a hat, Stern created the name Ritz, which appealed to individuals suffering in the Great Depression, offering them "a bite of the good life". He also created the blue circle/yellow lettering logo design. In 2011, Ritz was listed as the "best perceived snack brand" among American consumers in a YouGov poll.</p>

    <p> Chips Ahoy! is a brand of cookie, baked and marketed by Nabisco, a subsidiary of Mondelēz International, that debuted in 1963. It is widely sold in the United States, Latin America (where its name in some countries is "Choco Chips"), South Africa, Canada, Latvia, Spain, Portugal, China, Indonesia, Taiwan, United Kingdom, Italy and many more regions. It is marketed in varieties of 1 ounce (28 g) mini-sized cookie packages to around 48 ounces (1,400 g) packages of standard-sized cookies. It is the third best-selling cookie in the United States after Oreo, also a Nabisco-branded cookie, with an average of US$619.4 million in sales per year. By the 1980s, several different varieties of the cookie snack were being baked and shipped to grocery stores: chewy, sprinkled, and striped. In Indonesia, Chips Ahoy! was relaunched in September 2015 after the product was discontinued in that country in the early 2010s.
Nabisco says the name is "a reference to the nautical term, Ships Ahoy!". The words "Chips Ahoy!" also feature prominently in a story appearing in Chapter 15 of "The Uncommercial Traveller", by Charles Dickens. Dickens relays a childhood tale of a girlfriend, named Chipselle, who is taunted by a bully who tormented her endlessly with, "Chips Ahoy!" There is also a 1956 American animated theatrical short titled Chips Ahoy. </p>
