<p> Welcome to my website, here I will talk about my love with food. This will include the following different areas of candy, snacks/chips, breakfast, lunch and dinner items. Along with providing my own opinion of the selected foods, I also intend to provide a breif history on the background of the food and where it originally came from as well as when it was created.</p>
