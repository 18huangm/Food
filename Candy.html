  <h2>Hard Candy</h2>

    <p> One of the types of my favorite candy includes hard candy. There are many varieties of hard candy such as candy canes, and lollipops just to name a few. In order to make hard candy, a sugar based mixture is heated to 160 Â°C and as it cools to room temperature that is when the candy becomes "hard candy" since it stiffens up as well as becomes brittle. On average for the most part hard candy is almost 100% sugar by weight. Hard candies are not just only a treat for the sweet tooth but they have been historically associated along wiht cough drops. Thes can be used medicinally to temporarily suppress coughs, as well as lubercates and soothes the irritated tissues of the throat. I like to suck on hard candies until they dissolve in my mouth, I just like the feeling of the candy slowly getting smaller and smaller the longer its in my mouth.</p>

    <p> Another one of my favorite type is gummi or jelly candy, they are relatively soft and very chewable. But, one of my favorite types of this candy would have to be gummi bears. These gummi candies don't only come in the shape of bears though, as they also come in the shapes of worms, frogs, snakes, cherries, peach rings, toy soldiers, and sharks to name a few. With that they come in an assortment of sizes too, from very little to huge. In my opinion, I think my favorite brand would have to be Haribo since the products that they put out are very good and they have such a great selection. Some facts about Haribo include, that they produced as well as introduced the first ever gummi bear  in 1920. This company produces well over 80 million gummi bears per day. The name "gummi" originated from Germany and is pronounced the same in the States but it's spelt gummy.</p>

  <h2>Chocolate</h2>

    <p> Chocolate is another one of my favorite candies to enjoy in my free time. There are many different kinds or types of chocolate such as milk, white, dark and unsweetened to name a few. Milk chocolate is contains either milk powder or condensed milk which in combination with the cocoa solids changes the taste from bitter to sweet instead. White chocolate has a similar texture to that of dark or milk chocolate but does not cantain any cocoa solids at all. Due to this fact some don't consider white chocolate even chocolate. Now dark chocolate, though not as sweet as milk chocolate is made by adding sugar and fat to the cacoa mixture. The more cocoa solids there is to the ratio of sugar indicates the bitterness. As for unsweetened chocolate, it is the pure chocolate liquor and is typically used in baking where sugatr and other types of ingredients are added. In my opinion I personally prefer either dark chocolate to milk chocolate, sometimes I find that some companies make their chocolate too sweet for my taste. </p>
