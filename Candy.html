    <p> One of the types of my favorite candy includes hard candy. There are many varieties of hard candy such as candy canes, and lollipops just to name a few. In order to make hard candy, a sugar based mixture is heated to 160 Â°C and as it cools to room temperature that is when the candy becomes "hard candy" since it stiffens up as well as becomes brittle. On average for the most part hard candy is almost 100% sugar by weight. Hard candies are not just only a treat for the sweet tooth but they have been historically associated along wiht cough drops. Thes can be used medicinally to temporarily suppress coughs, as well as lubercates and soothes the irritated tissues of the throat. I like to suck on hard candies until they dissolve in my mouth, I just like the feeling of the candy slowly getting smaller and smaller the longer its in my mouth.
