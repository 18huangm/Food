      <h2>Town and Country Diner</h2>
      <p> Food is great, I give it a 10, and you can always take half of it home for another meal.  The hostesses are wonderful and the manager is a pleasure to visit.  The waiters and waitresses are always there checking on you. So the staff is also a 10.  I have never visited the bar. </p>

      <h2>Mastoris</h2>
      <p>We went there on a recommendation and I'm glad we followed through! They have a nice pastry shop upon entering. The ambience is amazing in each section of the restaurant (they actually have a diner section that will time warp you into the 50s), and the food was very delicious! I had a slight problem with my dish (I didn't know my eggs in this dish would be over easy) and the courteous waiter and staff obliged me with making a new one to my exact liking! I rarely give 5 stars on here, but they deserve it! The price was decent too!
